### Steps for RNA-seq-based variant calling using RG-StraP

1. FastQC + MultiQC (check quality of raw data)
2. TrimGalore (trim adapters)
3. After trimming, run 2-pass mapping using STAR (STAR.sh, then 2pass_STAR.sh).
#NOTE: Check BAM file with Picard's ValidateSamFile (validbam.sh) each time a BAM is generated.
4. Add read group using Picard's AddOrReplaceReadGroups (addReadGroup.sh). [NOT A LOOP, CUSTOM CODE]
5. MERGE BAM files per sample (mergeBAM.sh); have a list of replicates per sample ready. [NOT A LOOP, CUSTOM CODE]
6. Filter reads with low MAPQ (<20) with samtools (filterBAM.sh).
7. Sort BAM files, identify + remove optical duplicates, then generate index with Picard's SortSam and MarkDuplicates (sortMarkDup.sh).
#NOTE: JAVA needs to be v1.8, or anything lower than 10
8. Split N Trim BAM file of N CIGAR reads using GATK's SpliNCigarReads (splitncigar.sh).
9. Base Score Recalibration with GATK's BaseRecalibrator (base_recalibrator.sh).
10. Apply base recalibration with GATK's applyBQSR (applyBQSR.sh), then run variant calling with GATK's HaplotypeCaller (haploCall.sh).
11. Merge GVCF files into a single VCF file with GATK's CombineGVCFs then perform joint genotyping with GATK's GenotypeGVCFs (genotypegvcfs.sh).
#NOTE: Check VCF file with Picard's ValidateVCF (validvcf.sh).
12. Filter variants with GATK's VariantFiltration (variantFil.sh) [QD < 2.0, MQ < 40.0, FS > 60.0, MQRankSum < -12.5, ReadPosRankSum < -8.0, DP < 2]
12b. SelectVariants (varSelect.sh) based on previous filtering step.
13. Clean up VCF file (remove duplicated SNPs, non-SNPs, non-ACGT alleles, ambiguous alleles, and non autosomal chromosomes).
13. LD pruning
13b. Check concordance, coverage, etc.
